# Welcome to PREDICTIONworld

The world leader of fantasy sports opinion on last minute decisions

Check out the website @ www.predictionworld.surge.sh

## Description
- Imagine this, you are with your friend watching the game and as the game progresses you began an argument because you think the Home team will win the game. You're friend disagrees as usual. 
- Once the game is over and the Home team wins, you tell your friend "see I told you they were going to win". Like a sore loser he replies "I don't remember you predicting that"
- Those times are now over with PREDICTIONworld!
- You can now post your prediction as soon as possible.
- Before the game is over post you prediction, and once it ends and you're right you have hard rock proof.

## Inspiration

I enjoy making predictions on who will win the upcoming game and between my family we always say "remember I called that they were going the game", but no one ever does. Well now we have a website to hold your predictions so you can prove your friends you had called it before tipoff!


## To Do
- [x] Initiate Routes
- [x] Created components needed 
- [x] Home page working 
- [x] Get NFL page working properly
- [x] MockAPI reading data loading correctly 
- [x] widgetAPI data loading correctly
- [x] createQuestion page working correctly
- [x] MockAPI creating data correctly
- [x] Add rotating animation to API data
- [x] Edit feature working correctly
- [x] Delete feature working correctly

# Ideas

- Authentication is a feature I would like to implement in the future, so only the Admin can delete predictions after they've occurred.
- Eventually I would like to add more functionality to the website in the sense of letting users navigate inside of each prediction and commenting on them.
- Another implementation I would like to do is make my third party API data be more useful than just arrest data. I would like to show a sports scores ticker like ESPN.

# Technology Used 

- React -> JavaScript library

    - First time using React, and it was a very cool and fun experience to learn about what React does and how it intereacts with third-party and mock data API's.
    - Creating components and using them was a real good way to see the real beauty behind react, and how making components reusable eventualy saved a lot of time.
    - The lifecycles and methods are also astonishing to think about the many ways that one can implement a lifecycle for different situations.
    



<!-- 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
